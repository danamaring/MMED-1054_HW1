	<p>My name is Shengrong Yang, I am from China.<br> I like dance most, including ballet, Latin dance, Chinese dance. 

           I have won numerous international dance medals and silver medals. I am part-time now a model. I am studying at

           UTM and also studying at Fanshawe. I want to create a design studio in the future.

    I find really interesting that Shengrong is studying at Fanshawe and also at UTM at the same time! That sounds really challenging and I admire that.
