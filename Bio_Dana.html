	<p>
		My name is Dana Marin Garcia. I am 23 years old. I was born in Colima, Mexico which is a very small city <br> where everyone knows each other. I studied a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Education and in the last semester I won<br> a scholarship to study English in Toronto, Canada for two months. After I finished and went back to Colima<br> I decided that I wanted to study something different related to design and programming in Canada and I<br> found the IDP3 program in Fanshawe and the rest is history. <br>
		I am an only child and when I lived in Mexico I worked on the family business which is a bicycles store.<br>
		Biking is one of my favorite hobbies besides video-editing, photography and teaching.
